For this project, I wanted to combine my interest in the airplanes flying overhead (I live near SFO and OAK) &ndash; and build my first &ldquo;robot&rdquo; that moves in the real world.

Historically I’ve used AirDrop or emailed the files to myself - typing out my email address each time. But now, I use OneShare.

We created Scribble so you can talk instead of type and there is a subset of PC users that absolutely love it. My favorite user story is they went out and replaced their windows machines with Macs just so they can use Scribble to get their work done. I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest going that crazy &ndash; but excited to have users that really want to talk!<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item">

They are everywhere and are simultaneously both loved and hated. Wouldn’t it be fun to have an inside look at the ride data from Lime or Bird? I’ve loved the visualizations, stories and insights gleaned from the Uber data in NYC. So, the Uber data as an example, I thought I’d try gather the data myself. Let’s see what we can find.
