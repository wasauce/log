I love ESPN highlight reels. What if a computer could automatically watch a game and create highlight reels all by itself.

First — why would that be interesting? Well the top Twitch Streamers need to create content (play video games), show off their skills and create a community. What better way to create community than making a highlight reel of you playing the various people you compete with on Fortnite.

Think about it this way, how much would I love to have a clip of me playing basketball against LeBron James? I’d kill for one — I’d show it to everyone even though everyone would see LeBron dunk on me literally and figuratively.

Today’s kids play eSports and unlike me vs LeBron some of them can actually beat their heros — and have video evidence.

Here is the output of the system built for watching Fortnite from streamers like @Ninja and extracting highlight clips that get automatically tweeted out at the streamer and the competitor.

#### So what are we seeing:

1. Computer watches a Twitch stream (e.g. 8 hours of Fortnite gameplay)
2. Computer finds the key moments (the kills)
3. Computer extracts the text on the screen (maybe @80% quality) to figure out who did what with what
4. Computer automatically creates the GIF and tweets it

#### What is the input?

A single 8 hour Fortnite stream.

That is what is impressive — there is no secondary data stream showing the key moments, there is no text feed showing what words appear on screen — all of this has to be extracted from the video.
