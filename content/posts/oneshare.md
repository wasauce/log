In my day to day, working on apps — I am constantly taking screenshots or videos — be it of bugs in our app or great flows in other apps and I need a way to easily get them off my phone.

Historically I’ve used AirDrop or emailed the files to myself - typing out my email address each time. But now, I use OneShare.

### Problem:
Get photos/videos/links/tweets/files off my phone and onto my computer / into my workflow.

### Solution: OneShare
 It’s a dead simple app intended to reduce the steps and allow me to 1 tap from the share screen and know the file/link/tweet/photo/video is in my email for later processing.

It saves me time and annoyance — so we packaged it up and put it in the App Store

I'd love your feedback on how we can make the app better for you. Our current top request boils down to making an AirDrop replacement -- something that always works -- and works cross platform (Android to Mac, iPhone to Windows).
